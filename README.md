Wanderlust-2
============

Wanderlust is deigned to be a open world adventure game you play in browser. 

Based on Castle of the Wind, ADarkRoom, & BrowserQuest by Mozilla (http://browserquest.mozilla.org/). All the graphics belong to Mozilla and I take no claim to them. 

This project was started on a while back as a tribute to the first Wanderlust I made for a school project. My intentions are for it to be similar to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_the_Winds but on a browser. Some of the major steps are to update all the code/plugins to be clean and easy to read, refactoring the functions file thus far, finishing the UI, and starting on the main game files.

Feel free to offer suggestions or push requests. Id love help wherever it may come from! -Dave
