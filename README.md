Wanderlust-2
============

Wanderlust is deigned to be a open world adventure game you play in browser. Based on BrowserQuest by Mozilla (http://browserquest.mozilla.org/). All the graphics belong to Mozilla and I take no claim to them. 

This project was started on a while back as a tribute to the first Wanderlust I made for a school project. Eventually Id like to finish it. My intentions is for it to be similar to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_the_Winds but on a browser.
